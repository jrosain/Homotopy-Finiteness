* Homotopy Finiteness

This webpage is a mirror of the formalisation of Rijke's proof that the number of groups of finite order is finite [3] in [[https://github.com/JonasHoefer/poset-type-theory/][Jonas Hoefer's prototype]], offered to have a better viewing experience than on GitHub.

The repository is organized as follows:
  - src/GroupFiniteness.html: the application of homotopy finiteness to groups.
  - src/HomotopyFiniteness.html: the main proof of this formalization.
  - src/Lib: a set of standard lemmas and theorem of Homotopy type theory.

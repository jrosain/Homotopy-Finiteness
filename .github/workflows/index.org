* Homotopy Finiteness

This webpage is a mirror of the formalisation of Rijke's proof that the number of groups of finite order is finite [3] in [[https://github.com/JonasHoefer/poset-type-theory/][Jonas Hoefer's prototype]], offered to have a better viewing experience than on GitHub.

You can start consulting the files by one of the following:
  - src/GroupFiniteness.html: the application of homotopy finiteness to groups.
  - src/HomotopyFiniteness.html: the main proof of this formalization.

Then, in each file, the imports are linked to facilitate browsing.

This file implements the classical functions of identity types. In =postt=, the identity is defined as a native type =Path=, while classically, it is defined is an inductive type with one constructor: =refl=.

** Reflexivity

First, we introduce the constant path: =refl=. In =postt=, paths are defined using an interval between 0 and 1. Thus, the constant path is the path that ignores its argument and always returns the same point.
#+BEGIN_SRC postt
refl (A : U) (x : A) : Path A x x =
  \i. x
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 
: Checking Definition: refl
: (A : U) -> (x : A) -> Path A x x
: \ A. \ x. \ i. x
: 
: Successfully checked 1 definitions
: Evaluation of \ A. \ x. \ i. x
: Yields \ A. \ x. \ i. x

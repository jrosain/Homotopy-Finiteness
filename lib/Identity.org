This file implements the classical functions of identity types. In =postt=, the identity is defined as a native type =Path=, while classically, it is defined is an inductive type with one constructor: =refl=.

** Reflexivity

First, we introduce the constant path: =refl=. In =postt=, paths are defined using an interval between 0 and 1. Thus, the constant path is the path that ignores its argument and always returns the same point.

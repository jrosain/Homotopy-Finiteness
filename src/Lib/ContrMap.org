* Contractible maps are bi-invertible

  #+begin_src ctt
  module Lib.ContrMap where
  #+end_src

This file shows that maps are contractible iff they are bi-invertible. The proof is not the usual one found in the HoTT book or Rijke's introduction to HoTT, but is the one found by Christian Sattler and David WÃ¤rn ([[https://github.com/sattlerc/hott-reading-course/blob/master/exams/practice/exam.pdf][source]]).

* The =is-finite= proposition

Finite types are types that can be counted. However, when defining finite types, we do not especially care about the counting, we only care about the fact that /it can be counted/, which translates in the definition by using [[Lib/Data/][propositional truncation]]. However, this definition is not practical as it does not give the number of elements. Hence, we also show that finite types are /logically equivalent/ to types with cardinalities.

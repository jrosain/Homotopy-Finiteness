This file states and shows useful properties of bi-invertible maps.

** 3-for-2 property of composition

** Double-composition property
Assume that there are maps =f : A \to B=, =g : B \to C= and =h : C \to D= such that =g \circ f= and =h \circ g= are bi-invertible. We show that =f=, =g= and =h= are all bi-invertible.

*** =f= and =h= are bi-invertible
We show a more general lemma -- that is, for any =f : A \to B= and =g : B \to C= such that =g \circ f= is bi-invertible, then =f= is bi-invertible. Indeed, let =i= be the inverse of =g \circ f=. Then, =i \circ g= is the inverse of =f=: =i \circ g \circ f= is obviously the identity, and =g \circ f \circ i \circ g ~ g= hence the result.

*** =g= is also bi-invertible
It directly follows from the 3-for-2 property of composition for bi-inverses.
